# Built with React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS

This a demo for a project I built for a client, refactored with Typescript and Vite. 

To spin up, use `npm install` or `yarn start` like any other React app. Runs on `localhost:3000`. Using Google Maps API to compute surface area and map data. You will need your own accounts for GCP and AWS Lambda to properly run locally.
